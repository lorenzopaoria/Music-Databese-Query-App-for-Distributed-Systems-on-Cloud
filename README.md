# Music Database Query App for Distributed Systems on Cloud

This repository contains the files for a database project that models a music streaming platform. The goal of this project is to design and implement a relational database schema that can effectively store and manage data related to users, artists, songs, playlists, and other essential entities in a music streaming application. All of this with the implementation of a distributed system using Maven, along with its management for the database created.

## Project Overview

The music streaming platform database project includes the following key components:

1. **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**: A visual representation of the database schema, showing the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
2. **Database Schema**: The detailed SQL code for creating the database schema, including tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.
3. **Sample Data**: A set of sample data that can be used to populate the database and test the application's functionality.
4. **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL queries that demonstrate how to perform various operations on the database, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data.
5. **Database Management Scripts**: Scripts for managing the database, such as backup, restore, and optimization procedures.

## Getting Started

To get started with the music streaming platform database project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lorenzopaoria/Database-Project-Music-Streaming-Platform.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd Database-Project-Music-Streaming-Platform
   ```
3. Review the project files, including the ER diagram, database schema, sample data, and SQL queries.
4. Use the provided SQL scripts to create the database schema and populate it with the sample data.
5. Explore the SQL queries and modify them as needed to perform various operations on the database.
6. Customize the database schema and queries to fit your specific requirements for the music streaming platform.

## Maven Installation

To use Maven in your project, you first need to install it. Follow these steps to install Maven:

### 1. Installation on Windows

1. Download the latest version of Maven from [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice, for example `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven`.
3. Add the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable pointing to the directory where you extracted Maven (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven`).
4. Add `C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.
5. Verify the installation by opening the command prompt and typing:
   ```bash
   mvn -v

   ```

You should see the installed version of Maven.

### 2. Running Profiles with Maven

Maven allows you to use profiles to configure various aspects of the build process, such as dependencies, plugins, and properties. To run a specific profile, you can use the mvn command with the -P option.

First, go in to mvnProject directory and execute the following command to clean and install dependencies:

```
mvn clean install
```

To run a profile defined in the pom.xml file, use the following command:

```
 mvn -Pserver exec:java
```

If you need to run a different profile, such as clientTest, you can specify it like this:

```
 mvn -Pclient exec:java
```

If you need to run a GUI profile, such as client, you can specify it like this:

```
 mvn -Pgui exec:java
```

## First start

Run ec2_start.py, update ip o config ssh on vscode, update credential in .aws
